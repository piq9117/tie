          Use this query parameter to filter for the packages thats suits your use case.
          It can be used by passing in either package names or package ids. 
          To query for multiple packages you can pass in comma separated values.
          For example:

          ```

          package_query=17ea97c0-d350-45ce-9f36-ebb66694196c,558664cd-fece-47f5-a9ca-f30974cf96a5,...

          ```

          Or if you prefer using package names, you can also pass in 

          ```

          package_query=package_name_1,package_name_2...

          ```
